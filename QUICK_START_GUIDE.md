# SONDE - Quick Start Guide to Making This Official

**TL;DR**: Complete 5 critical tasks this week, submit grant for $150K, and launch the phone that pays you.

---

## ⚡ WHAT IS SONDE?

**SONDE** turns your Solana Seeker phone into a passive income machine earning $5-25/month by sharing sensor data (WiFi, GPS, cell signal, etc.) with enterprises.

**Key Differentiator**: TEEPIN hardware attestation makes data unfakeable → enterprises pay 3-10x more → you earn more.

**Market**: $70B+ TAM, proven by OpenSignal ($100M+ exit) and Grass Network (3M users).
