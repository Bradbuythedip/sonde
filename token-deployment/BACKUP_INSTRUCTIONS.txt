CRITICAL: BACKUP YOUR WALLET
=============================

Your wallet contains the private key that controls:
- Your SOL balance
- Your SONDE tokens
- Mint authority (ability to create more tokens)

If you lose access to this wallet, you lose everything!

BACKUP CHECKLIST:
-----------------

[ ] Step 1: Write down seed phrase
    - When you created the wallet, you saw 12-24 words
    - Write these on paper (NOT digital)
    - Store in 3 separate physical locations:
      * Home safe
      * Bank safe deposit box
      * Trusted family member

[ ] Step 2: Backup keypair file
    File location: ~/sonde-wallet/deployer-keypair.json
    
    Copy to:
    [ ] USB drive (2 copies)
    [ ] Encrypted cloud backup
    [ ] External hard drive

[ ] Step 3: Encrypt backups
    gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 deployer-keypair.json
    # Creates deployer-keypair.json.gpg (encrypted)
    # Store encrypted version in cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive)

[ ] Step 4: Test recovery
    # Try recovering from seed phrase
    solana-keygen recover --outfile test-recovery.json
    # Enter your seed phrase
    # Verify it produces same public key

[ ] Step 5: Document everything
    Create a document with:
    - Token mint address
    - Deployer wallet public key
    - Date of deployment
    - Network (devnet/mainnet)
    - Location of backups

RECOVERY PROCESS:
-----------------

If you lose your wallet file but have seed phrase:

1. solana-keygen recover --outfile new-wallet.json
2. Enter your seed phrase
3. Verify: solana-keygen pubkey new-wallet.json
4. Should match your original public key

If you lose everything (no seed phrase, no keypair):
- Your tokens are PERMANENTLY LOST
- No one can recover them
- This is why backups are critical!

SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
------------------------

✅ DO:
- Keep seed phrase offline (paper only)
- Use multiple backup locations
- Encrypt digital backups
- Test recovery process
- Use hardware wallet for large amounts

❌ DON'T:
- Store seed phrase digitally (no photos, no cloud)
- Share private key with anyone
- Use same wallet for testing and mainnet
- Keep all tokens in one wallet
- Forget to test backups

COLD STORAGE SETUP:
-------------------

For maximum security, create a cold storage wallet:

1. Create offline computer (air-gapped)
2. Generate wallet on offline computer
3. Transfer 90% of tokens to cold wallet
4. Store cold wallet seed phrase in bank vault
5. Use hot wallet (10%) for daily operations

This way, even if your hot wallet is compromised,
90% of tokens remain safe in cold storage.

REMEMBER: You are your own bank. No one can help you recover lost keys!
