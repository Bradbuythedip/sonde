## ⚠️ Weaknesses to Address

### Team Section ⚠️
Currently placeholder text - hurts credibility. Fill in real credentials.

### No TEEPIN Prototype ⚠️
Integration not yet validated. Get confirmation from Solana Mobile that it's feasible.

### No Community Traction ⚠️
Beta signups, surveys, or interest metrics would strengthen the proposal.

### No Enterprise LOIs ⚠️
Letters of intent from potential customers would de-risk enterprise sales assumptions.

## 📞 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Review GRANT_CHECKLIST.md
2. Fill in team section (1-2 hours)
3. Add contact information
4. Fix premature checkmarks

### This Week
5. Create beta signup form (Google Form)
6. Post in Seeker Discord for interest validation
7. Reach out to 2-3 potential advisors
8. Get TEEPIN feasibility confirmation

### Post-Submission
9. If approved: Execute Phase 1 roadmap
